# Control the robot using the buttons

Do you want to control your robot's behavior through some buttons on a web page?
This requires creating a web page and a database and then linking it to the Arduino to move it to your board

Let's see how we can do that
First of all, we will create a local web page and a database (localhost) using XAMPP, we talked about that earlier, to see [click here](https://github.com/alaserimaha/Save-HTML-Form-value-to-MySQL-using-PHP)

Now let's start with the steps of creating our project

## 1- Create a web page that includes robot control buttons
## 2- Create a database to store the instructions in
## 3- Create a php page to connect the web page and the database
## 4- Connect the Arduino to the database to read and apply the commands

## 1- Create a web page that includes robot control buttons
We will create a simple page, which includes 5 navigation buttons (Backward ، Forward, Right, Left and Stop) and when you press any of them, it will convert the value of the button to a php page with the help of GET mehthod .

We wrote a simple html code to represent this idea ، you can find the html code from the attachments above [control_robot.php](https://github.com/alaserimaha/Control-the-robot-using-the-buttons/blob/main/control_robot.php)

## 2- Create a database to store the instructions in

As we mentioned in the [previous repository](https://github.com/alaserimaha/Control-the-robot-using-the-buttons/blob/main/control_robot.php), the steps for creating a local database using XAMPP, we do the same, but the change is in the type of variable that will be stored
Since we want to store a letter where the letter represents the direction of movement, if the command is `left`, the letter `l` will be stored in the database, and so on

To view the steps to create the database again:
1) Open XAMPP and run Apache Web Server and MySQL Database
2) Go to application and open phpmyadmin by searching http://localhost/phpmyadmin/
3) From the bar, create a new database ( from new button ), let's say its name is (db)
4) Create a table inside the database, let's say its name is (table)
5) For our example, we only need one column of type VARCHAR , let's say its name is (value)

## 3- Create a php page to connect the web page and the database
To connect the web page to the database, we need to create a php page where it receives the movement from the web page (for example `right`) and takes the letter that represents it (in this case `r`) and then connects with the database to store this character, if the storage process is successful it appears Message (The char .... has been stored Successfully)
We wrote a php page to represent it ، you can find it from the attachments above [functioncalling.php](https://github.com/alaserimaha/Control-the-robot-using-the-buttons/blob/main/functioncalling.php)
